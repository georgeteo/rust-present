# Rust Present

Rust Present is a Rust presentation tool modeled after Go Present.

We aim to provide a basic presentation engine for the Rust community, in which
it is easy to run code.

## TODO

1. Create concrete syntax for .slide modeled after Go Present.
2. Parser (scanner is trivial use of std::read)
3. Cross-Compile to HTML
4. Serve HTML via websocket
5. Set up async code runs via websockets.
